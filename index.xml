      <description>Summary The purpose of this study was to identify a gene with intersecting Gli binding sites and H3K27ac hallmarks that have associations with human limb abnormalities. The intersection between HH responsive H3K27ac sites and Gli binding region identified 340 active Gli enhancers target genes with about 20+ sites mostly involved with limb, digit, and embryonic morphogenesis. One of these genes was selected for an in-depth analysis to determine the likelihood of Gli enhancers mediated Hedgehog signaling in this gene that regulates limb development.</description>

      <description>Speaking Two Different Languages Over the course of this semester in Computational Biology, I have come to realize that unlike many languages around the world, coding languages are pretty transferable. Mastering one could potentially make it much easier to pick up another and, better yet, there are packages that allow you to speak both languages at the same time and have them seamlessly interact. Being the genetics nerd I am, I find it easiest to illustrate the interactions between R and Python using the very functions that determine who we are from the essence of our being - gene expression.</description>

When it was first created in 1985, there were only 3 critera for a movie to pass the test: 1. the movie must have (at least) two named women in it 2. who talk to each other 3.</description>
